# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Rust Solutions

Solutions to the exercises of the popular computing textbook - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman

This repo is for me to practice the problems as I read this excellent book.
I decided to do the problems in Rust rather than LISP for a few reasons.

1. There are already LISP repos out there
2. Rust is my preferred language
3. Rust is a good candidate for a modern general purpose language

I am using the Second Edition
